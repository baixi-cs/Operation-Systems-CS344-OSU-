We have to create our own Shell in C that create child processes and handles file IO...so on an so forth. This was one of the cooles
Assignments I've ever done and I'm really proud of my work. In hind-sight I could've done better, like throwing my PID reaping
for loop at the end of the main loop, but s'all good. At the time I was just racing to get it done.

Go through the p3testscript to see what all it can do :)
